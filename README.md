# Retina-Damage-Detection-
### Objective:
The goal of this project is to utilize conventional neural networks to classify Retina Damage with best accuracy possible.
### Requirements:
-numpy
-tensorflow
-matplotlib
### Approach :
-we will load the train,test,validation data
-First problem we face that the classes were imbalanced so we made them at the same level
